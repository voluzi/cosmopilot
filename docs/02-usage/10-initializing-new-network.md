# Initializing a New Network

`Cosmopilot` can generate a new genesis to create an entirely new network, making it ideal for launching testnets. This is achieved by configuring `.spec.validator.init` in both `ChainNode` and `ChainNodeSet` resources.

::: warning Important
This feature is intended for testnets. Avoid using it to create production networks.
:::

## Basic Configuration

Refer to the [GenesisInitConfig](/03-reference/crds/crds#genesisinitconfig) for details on all available fields. Here’s an example of a basic configuration:

```yaml
validator:
  init:
    chainID: my-testnet-1
    stakeAmount: "1000000unibi"
    assets:
      - "100000000unibi"
      - "500000000uusdt"
```

This configuration will create a new network with the ID `my-testnet-1` and a single validator with assets of `100000000unibi` and `500000000uusdt`, staking `1000000unibi`.


## Providing Validator Info

::: warning Important
Currently, Cosmopilot supports only one validator in a single `ChainNodeSet`. You can provision additional validators by adding extra `ChainNode` resources like in this [example](/04-examples/cosmos/multi-validator-devnet).
:::

When initializing a new network, you can provide additional validator details using the `.spec.validator.info` field:

```yaml{2-4}
validator:
  info:
    moniker: nibiru
    website: https://nibiru.fi
  init:
    chainID: my-testnet-1
    stakeAmount: "1000000unibi"
    assets:
      - "100000000unibi"
      - "500000000uusdt"
```

## Account Prefixes

By default, `Cosmopilot` uses the `cosmos` prefix for accounts. If the network requires different prefixes, you can customize them:

```yaml{2-3}
validator:
  accountPrefix: cosmos
  valPrefix: cosmosvaloper
  init:
    chainID: my-testnet-1
    stakeAmount: "1000000uatom"
    assets: ["100000000uatom"]
```

## Additional Accounts

To fund other accounts, such as those for faucets or external tools, you can include them in the configuration:

```yaml{8-10}
validator:
  init:
    chainID: my-testnet-1
    stakeAmount: "1000000unibi"
    assets:
      - "100000000unibi"
      - "500000000uusdt"
    accounts:
      - address: nibi10jf963eruna3clq4c4jwsj3k4jf5snp3z3q372
        assets: ["100000000unibi", "500000000uusdt"]
```

Additionally, if you are adding accounts to be used by other `ChainNode`s (for other validators for example), you can use the account already created for them by `Cosmopilot`. For that, you can use:

```yaml{8-12}
validator:
  init:
    chainID: my-testnet-1
    stakeAmount: "1000000unibi"
    assets:
      - "100000000unibi"
      - "500000000uusdt"
    chainNodeAccounts:
      - chainNode: my-testnet-1-validator-2
        assets: [ "100000000000000unibi", "10000000000000000uusdt" ]
      - chainNode: my-testnet-1-validator-3
        assets: [ "100000000000000unibi", "10000000000000000uusdt" ]
```

::: tip NOTE
`Cosmopilot` will wait for the referenced `ChainNode` resources to exist and have their accounts ready before proceeding with the initialization.
:::

## Voting and Bonding Periods

For testnets, it is common to use shorter bonding and voting periods for faster testing. You can configure these as follows:

```yaml{5,6}
validator:
  init:
    chainID: my-testnet-1
    stakeAmount: "1000000unibi"
    unbondingTime: 60s
    votingPeriod: 60s
    assets:
      - "100000000unibi"
      - "500000000uusdt"
```

## Custom Genesis Changes

For more advanced genesis customizations, you can use the `.spec.validator.init.additionalInitCommands` field to execute additional initialization steps using custom containers.

::: info Available Mounts
- **`/home/app`**: Application home directory. The genesis file is typically located at `/home/app/config/genesis.json`. The validator account is available on the `test` keyring as `account`.
- **`/temp`**: Temporary volume shared between initialization containers, useful for data sharing.
:::

### Example: Adding a Sudo Root Account

On a [Nibiru](https://nibiru.fi) network, you can add a sudo root account to the genesis using:

```yaml{8-15}
validator:
  init:
    chainID: my-testnet-1
    stakeAmount: "1000000unibi"
    assets:
      - "100000000unibi"
      - "500000000uusdt"
    additionalInitCommands:
      - image: ghcr.io/nibiruchain/nibiru:1.5.0 # optional, defaults to the image use by the ChainNode.
        command: [ "sh", "-c" ] # optional, defaults to image entrypoint.
        args:
          - >
            nibid genesis add-sudo-root-account \
              $(nibid keys show account -a --home=/home/app --keyring-backend test) \
              --home=/home/app
```
